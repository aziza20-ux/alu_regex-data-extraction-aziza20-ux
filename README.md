 Overview of the Regex-Based Data Extraction Project
This project is a Regular Expression (Regex)-powered web data extraction tool designed to extract structured information from large text sources. The application scans text for specific patterns—such as emails, URLs, phone numbers, and credit card numbers—and returns organized results.

This could be useful for:
✅ Data scraping & cleaning
✅ Form validation (e.g., checking user inputs)
✅ Automated data extraction (e.g., processing logs, extracting contact details)
